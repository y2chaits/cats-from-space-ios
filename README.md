# cats-from-space-ios

A submission for the [Volcanoes, Icebergs, and Cats from Space](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/volcanoes-icebergs-and-cats-space/) challenge at [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2015](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org).

##Background
The world is a big place. And there’s a lot to see. Too much to see, in fact. NASA’s fleet of Earth-observing satellites looks at the entire planet every day, silently observing volcanoes erupt, icebergs calve, and cat-shaped clouds form. Some of these events are found by scientists looking for them, but many more go unnoticed due to the sheer volume of satellite imagery available. Everyone finds different aspects of our planet interesting; and this challenge encourages you to find and share from your own perspectives. 

##Challenge
We need you to develop an app to crowdsource the discovery of “interesting” natural events as observed from space using data from NASA’s Earth observation satellites -- such as wildfires burning, volcanoes erupting, or icebergs cracking. If all of you are helping us look for Earth events, by using a common interface you create with this challenge, we can discover more together than a few scientists can discover alone. And, we can share your discoveries with the world.
